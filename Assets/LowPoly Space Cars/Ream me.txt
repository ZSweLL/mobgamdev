LowPoly Space Cars


All models are available in .fbx format in "Models" folder

Fbx "unwraped" models are using one texture named "all-in-one-colors" to reduce the size of project

Fbx "colored" models are using color materials available in "separated color materials" folder.
You can change colors or add your own colors and make cars with whatever colors that you want.

All cars are available as prefabs in "prefabs" folder.
